# trashsort 🚮
A trash sorting system (as explained in the repo name) that will:
 - Sort trash by wet and dry using [Teachable Machine by Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
 - Display the capacity of the wet and dry bin using an ultrasonic sensor linked to a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), using flask to communicate to a React webpage.
 - Empty the trash into a buggy, which will drive it to a warehouse.
 - This solves the issue of trash not being segregated correctly in many places, and makes it nearly effortless to segregate.
